👋 Hi, I'm Harikishan! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

👀 I'm passionate about learning new technologies and expanding my skillset. I have experience in C, C++, Java, and Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm particularly interested in web development and have proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌱 Currently, I am focusing on mastering the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for full-stack web development. I believe it's an exciting and versatile technology stack that enables me to build robust and scalable web applications.

💼 I have uploaded projects and solved coding questions to showcase my skills and demonstrate my understanding of different programming concepts.

🤝 I'm open to collaboration and working on interesting projects. If you have any ideas or opportunities, feel free to reach out to me. You can contact me via email at harikishanmittal198@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Let's connect and build amazing things together! 🚀
